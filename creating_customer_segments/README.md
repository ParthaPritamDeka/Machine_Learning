# Project 3: Unsupervised Learning
## Creating Customer Segments

In this project I have applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I have first explorde the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I have preprocessed the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I applied PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I compared the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
