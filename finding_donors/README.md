## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project I have used several supervised learning algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. census. Then, I chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. My goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether they should reach out to begin with.
