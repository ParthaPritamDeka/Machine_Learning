I think Random Forest is a good candidate for this problem - We have a high featured dataset and RF is efficient for that and also RF do not expect linear features or even features that interact linearly.

    "2. Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. As quoted in the paper in the link below: Gradient Boosting is mostly used in the field of genomic research. Gradient Boosting can be used as a SNP Filter - an Evaluation Using Simulated and Hair Morphology Data. SNP stands for single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Typically, genome-wide association studies consist of regressing the phenotype on each SNP separately using an additive genetic model. Although statistical models for recessive, dominant, SNP-SNP, or SNP-environment interactions exist, the testing burden makes an evaluation of all possible effects impractical for genome-wide data. A two-step approach is advocated where the first step consists of a filter that is sensitive to different types of SNP main and interactions effects. The aim is to substantially reduce the number of SNPs such that more specific modeling becomes feasible in a second step. “gradient boosting machine” (GBM) can be used as a filter. GBM builds a predictive model iteratively by adding “weak learners” (simple trees). The “weak learners” can be small regression or classification trees that are grown to a user- specified, usually small, number of splits.  At each split a single SNP is selected to split the sample into two parts called “daughter nodes”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882018/\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting is based on weak learners (high bias, low variance). In terms of decision trees, weak learners simple trees trees, say for e.g trees with two leaves. Boosting reduces error mainly by reducing bias. The idea is to add a classifier at a time, so that the next classifiers is trained to improve the already trained ensemble.GB build trees one at a time, where each new tree helps to correct errors made by previously trained tree. With each tree added, the model becomes even more expressive. There are typically three parameters - number of trees, depth of trees and learning rate, and the each tree built is generally shallow. \n",
    "\n",
    "- GB training generally takes longer because of the fact that trees are built sequentially. However benchmark results have shown GBDT are better learners than Random Forests. \n",
    "\n",
    "- GB has most of strengths of RF and can used for similar use case except that GB needs hyper parameter with  tunes to avoid overfitting and its slow compared to RF as trees are built sequentially starting with a week learner correcting the errors made by the previous tree in the next tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Research and experiments say that as a whole a well tuned GB can outperform an RF\n",
    "\n",

The paper mentions that more localized optimal solution has been attained using SGD to determine the determine the weights(compared to vanilla gradient descent). SGD does micro batch updates on the parameters to minimize the error by running small samples of data compared to GD which only update the weights after running through all the data points. So SGD would converge faster for large datasets and SGD starts improving itself right away from the first sample.\n",

    "- SGD often converges much faster compared to GD but the error function is not as well minimized as in the case of GD.

Due to its stochastic nature, SGD's path towards the global cost minimum is not direct as in GD\n",

    " - Another weekness for SGD would be in using constant step sizes .It may not guarantee convergence to the global optimum. We might oscillate around near the global optima without actually converging if we donot keep decreasing the step sizes as we keep iterating. The main disadvantage of using a constant step size is that if the function is not smooth enough, we might overshoot and end up at a higher function value than where we were previously.\n",

Also, Gradient Descent might take lot of time to converge if the dataset is large or has too many dimensions. Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (with SVM) (prerebaly with a non-linear SVM as there are many dimensions chances are that their will be a non-linear margin between the hyperplanes - loss=‘squared_hinge’ ) might be better off in this case because of batch updates and might converge faster compared to a Gradient descent based classifier."

Performancewise this model is the best with a F1 score of .7794 on the test dataset with the model trained on all 300 training points. Also the F1 score on the training data is .9739 which is quite high (not a highly biased model at all) and a score of .7794 indicates there is overfitting but this is the best we have achieved among all three models. We can definitely  increase the F1 score on the test data by tuning the model as GradientBoosting requires hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting. The training and testing time are well below 1 sec (.068 sec and .0028 sec) and would use minimum resources. \n",

    "**Answer: ** Gradient Boosting is a combination of multiple Decision based models. It starts with a simple model for training. Boosting reduces error mainly by increasing the robustness of the next model . The idea is to add a model at a time, so that the next model is trained to improve the already trained combination of models. So, the combined/ensembled becomes more expressive. The training phase takes little longer compared to other models because of the fact that the models are built sequentially. However in terms prediction accuracy, research shows Gradient Boosting is better then just \"simple Decision tree\" as well other \"combined decision tree\" based models such as Random Forest. We can also see that prediction accuracy of the model on the test dataset has increased from 75% to 78% when we trained the model on 300 datapoints than on 100 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the decision boundary established during the training phase, the model would evaluate a new record and identify the boundary as Pass (yes) or fail (no). For e.g. A student who does not fulltime job, less time, whose travel parents went to college, have access to internet is likely to fall in the \"pass\" bounday.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Note: Its impossible to vizualize a decision surface which is based on many different features ( 30 in this case) which is a hyerplane. Vizualizing a decision surface based on only two different features would not be right in this case as there too many features that are affecting hyperplane decision boundary. My explanation on prediction in Layman terms is purely based on some observations as well best guess jugement call on some features. I am finding it hard to imagine a complex decision tree based on so many features.\n",

This means the model is performing well on the test data although the performance on the train data has decreased, the model has definitely reached a fine tuned spot between bias and variance with optimal performace. The final model's variance has decreased compared to the previous one with little compromise on bias."
